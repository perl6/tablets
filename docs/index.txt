% Perl 6 Tablets: Table of Contents

These are the Perl 6 Tablets, a comprehensive manual, aiming to support
many different ways of learning. The content is nicely sorted and
indexed and many links allow you to follow your interest freely. For a
lightweight introduction, try
[the Perl 6 Tutorial written by Herbert Breunung](http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_tutorial)
or the community Book [Using Perl
6](https://github.com/perl6/book). If that is
too easy, read [the specs](http://perlcabal.org/syn/).
