% Perl 6 Tablets: Appendix D - Perl 5 to Perl 6 Delta

Trends
======

Ubiquity
--------

As always, [Perl is optimized for freedom and richness of
expression](language-design.html).



General Purpose
---------------

Perl 5 still has a lot of builtins, showing for which task the
language was created. But to become more general purpose, the core was
enhanced and some other parts got removed. File IO, Network and IPC,
Formats, and finally that long deprecated pre P5 DB-binding (dbmopen)
went out of the core or at least into sensible module namespace. The
optional type system enables compiler optimisations to make Perl even
usable in cases where you had to switch to C before.



Less Unix Centric
-----------------

Perl 1 was a child of the Unix world, borrowing a lot of folklore and
words. As Perl 6 had to regularize the Regex and reform some other
parts, this heritage has become less visible.



Unicode
-------

Per default all Perl 6 code is Unicode and you can use any weird
character for any part of the syntax.



Simple English
--------------

In Perl 5 we had my, our, use, require, bless, can, ISA (is a), chop
and also of course if, else, goto and all the loops. Perl 6 adds
given, when, gather, take, loop, WHERE, HOW, WHO and lot more everyday
English, which should make it easy to read and understand.



Hidden Complexity
-----------------

Even simple Perl 6 looks pretty much like older Perl, it has a
tremendous complexity inside, which only have to show up if you really
need it.



Functional Programming
----------------------

High order functions, currying, you name it. All that goodies are
there, as Perl 6 aims to a full support of functional programming.



Object Oriented
---------------

OOP syntax is now more simplified, compact, knows about encapsulation
and has many new features, including dynamic class composition.

Like in Smalltalk or Ruby every "thing" (values, vars, blocks,
routines) is an object and ops are "just" methods. It helps to have
internally everything in its place. But programmer still can pretend
it's not the case.



Full Introspection
------------------

Because every object knows his attributes and methods, you can ask the
compiler nearly anything about the state of your program.



Metalanguage
------------

And because classes are made to get extended or changed, Perl 6 has
not only full metaprogramming capabilities, beyond your wildest
dreams. It is a metalanguage with a beginner friendly default that
aims to become a family of languages. Rule of thumb: everything is
allowed, as long as you declare it.



One Spec - Many Implementations
-------------------------------

Unlike every other Perl so far, Perl 6 has a precise specification,
written in Perl 6. This allows to have several implementations, even
syntactical compatible ones.



Syntactical Changes
===================

  * *use strict* and *warnings* and *utf* are on by default



Operator
--------

  * `->` (arrow) becomes `.` (dot) - for method calls: object.method;
  * `=~` becomes `~~` - use regex now only with smartmatch
  * `qw( ... )` (exists still) becomes `< ... >`. With interpolation and quote protection: `<< ... >>`
  * `|` becomes `+|` - logical bit operation in numerical context
  * `&` becomes `+&`
  * `^` becomes `+^`
  * `<<` becomes `+<` - shifting numerical values
  * `>>` becomes `+>`
  * `.` becomes `~` (tilde) - for concatenate strings: 'Shinmen Musahashi: ' ~ 'Sho Rin No Sho';
  * `..` becomes `ff` - flipflop operator
  * `...` becomes `fff`
  * `cmp` becomes `leg` - `cmp` is now for general comparison, `leg` in string context
  * `? :` becomes `?? !!` - ternary operator
  * `length` becomes `chars` - number of chars in a string



Variable
--------

  * consistent sigils: so `@array[1]` replaces `$array[1]` and
    `%hash{'key'}` replaces `$hash{'key'}` and `%hash{'key1', 'key2'}`
    replaces `@hash{'key1', 'key2'}`
  * `$hash{'key'}` is now mostly `%hash<key>`
  * `scalar @a` becomes `+@a`
  * arrays, hashes, formats, directories and filehandles are internal
    objects with procedural Interfaces and can be saved in scalar
    variables.
  * [special variables](appendix-b-grouped.html#special-variables)
     have their own namespace (`$*VARNAME` and `$?VARNAME`),
     also token (`__LINE__`) will now be found there
  * no *Data::Dump*, use `$var.perl.say` instead

Strings
-------

  * no *length*, `length(@a)` is now `elems @a` and `length $str` is `chars $str;`
  * no *ucfirst* use **titlecase**


Flow Control
------------

  * no *each*, use `.pairs` or `.kv` instead
  * no *foreach*
  * no C-style *for*, use `loop` instead, 
  * `do {...} while (...);` becomes `repeat {...} while ...;`


Else
----

  * define classes with 'class' and modules with 'module'
  * no more source filters, but macros
  * no more references, bind variables on the symbol table


News
====

  * new contexts: hashlist, lazy list, bool, int, num, string
  * optional typing, traits (properties of variables), binding
  * `loop` and `say` commands
  * zip, err, yadda, and pipe operators
  * hyper / reduction operators
  * chained comparison operators
  * case construct with given and when
  * junctions : `if $a = 1|2|3`
  * currying
  * smartmatch / rules (regex++, own sublanguage within the language like in Rebol)
  * named parameters for subroutines, multimethods, coroutines
  * more explicit OOP:
      * autogenerated getters/setters
      * roles (similar to Ruby's Mixins, or Java's Interfaces)
  * delegation, design by contract (Eiffel)
  * exceptions, continuations
  * macros



Native Perl 6 (new idioms)
==========================

  * no parentheses required for control expressions after `if`, `unless`, `while` ... (but still allowed)
  * `%hash<key>` instead of `%hash{'key'}`, or `%hash<< key1 key2 >>` instead of `%hash{ 'key1', 'key2' }`
  * `loop` instead of `while (1)`
