Main Goal
=========

Enjoy life and **enjoy the freedom of expressing yourself**. Which
means: support you as much as possible, and not force you in any
way. Perl 6 tries to be even better than Perl 5 as your humble servant
for translating your thoughts into executable code (if possible).



Strategy
========

Every style and level of expertise has to be supported. And even more
difficult: all of them have to play well together. The default often
imitates a natural language (e.g., English). The following
oft-repeated terms encapsulate strategies and concepts for this.



Terms
=====



TIMTOWTDI
---------

Perl's everlasting slogan: "There is more then one way to do it,"
meaning your way is valid, too. Just be aware of logical consequences.



Visual Metaphor
---------------

People like to see their code as a picture at first glance. Therefore
names and operators should be distinctive, similar things should look
similar, different things different. Larry likes to add: weird things
should also look weird. And sometimes even characters can be
ideograms; like the Z meta-operator, which shows visually how it works
(first left, then right, then next left, etc.).



Topicalizer
-----------

This also has to do with natural attention flow. If a topic or first
word of a sentence sets an understandable context for what follows,
the meaning is built up word for word. This is much easier to grasp,
than if the last word of a block resolves the block's entire meaning
(like regex modifiers do in Perl 5). In particular,
[`for`](block.html#) and [`given`](block.html#) are called
topicalizers, because they set `$_`, the current topic variable.



Context sensitive
-----------------

The same term or symbol might do different things in different
contexts, although we have done our very best to consistently
represent the same general idea. Maybe the best example is [the \* aka
Whatever](#). But every context is its own domain, optimized to solve
the problems of that domain.



Maximum reuse
-------------

Not only is syntax reused to minimize the stuff you have to remember,
but concepts are reused also, wherever possible. For example, Pairs
are used to build hashes or named parameters in routines calls. There
are plenty more examples. Maybe the biggest one: the regex engine that
parses your code is the same engine you use in your program.



No special rules
----------------

Most of the special rules that plagued Perl 5 are gone or generalized.



One pass parsing
----------------

Perl 6 is much easier to understand, both for people and also for
software parsers. The language is designed to be understood by
machines in one read, dividing the source in smaller and smaller
units. As a nice side effect: syntax errors can only damage the
understanding of small units.



Keep easy things easy and hard things possible
----------------------------------------------

Beside TIMTOWTDI, the other ancient slogan is "Make easy things easy
and hard things possible." Even if nearly every cool idea is crammed
into Perl 6, we don't lose track of the basics. Features are made as
accessible and free of artificial prerequisites as possible. For
example, printing a variable as a line without explicit quotes and
newline (`say $var`), or reading a file without a file handle
(`slurp("filename").lines`). Rule of thumb: if you can think of a
concept as trivial, then it should be. On the other hand, if you can
think of a computable solution, it should at least be doable in Perl
(no artificial walls). Huffman coding: This is a refinement of the last
rule - common, often used things have short, straightforward
names. More verbose names indicate more rare, harder to grasp
concepts, or things that overwrite the default rules ("weird things
should look weird"). It also implies that the defaults lean toward
what a beginner (non-Perl 5 programmer) might expect ("hide the fancy
stuff").



Water bed theory of linguistic complexity
-----------------------------------------

This philosophy underlies the two previous terms. All Perl words
should reflect logical units which can be freely combined. Making it
more complicated than necessary is obviously not desirable. But
oversimplification will create artificial complexity somewhere
else. Like a water bed, where you can press down in one place but the
water will go up in another.  All your paradigms are belong to us. We
learn, take and adapt from every source possible to offer the best of
all breeds. You should be able to keep your style when switching to
Perl. Perl 6 supports the structured, object oriented, aspect
oriented, functional, design by contract, declarative and logic
programming paradigms.


<!-- I'm not sure this should be seen here as part of language design docs. 
Our major goal here is to put perl6 in the best possible light. This seems to
be talking managerese -->

Buzzword compliant
------------------

This term is an extension to the previous. Not only every programming
paradigm, but also every technique or neat trick loudly marketed out
there as "must have" "in the \[%DATE%\]", should be available in Perl 6
(or at least be possible), as long there is expressive value in it. A
few examples include "named parameters", "lvalue subroutines",
"parametizable subclasses", or "hygienic macros".



Second system syndrome
----------------------

We are very aware that many ambitious software projects that are
rebuilt from scratch fail. Especially those which aim to be "even
better in all ways" successors of already successful creations. In
fact, this happens so often that the term "second system syndrome" was
coined. We chose this path for Perl 6 anyways, because we believe it's
the only way to get a significantly better language.
(Gradual improvements are flowing into Perl 5 all the time,
sometimes inspired by Perl 6.) That's why the unofficial motto of
Perl 6 is "Second system syndrome done right".



Trends
======

As a consequence of these principles, [various trends can be
observed](appendix-d-delta.html#trends).



Design Process
==============

The initial source of the Perl 6 design came from 361 RFC (Requests For
Comments) submissions by people from all over the world. Larry Wall
sorted and commented on them in several documents called the
Apocalypses (meaning "revelations"). Damian Conway wrote, for each
Apocalypse, an Exegesis ("explanation"), that expounded on Larry's
ideas. These are now all historic documents that not have changed
since, because they were much harder to maintain than the Synopses
("abstracts" or "comparisons" (with Perl 5)). The Synopsis documents,
along with the test suite, form the official specification of Perl 6. 
More details on that can be found in
[the history section](tablet-0-history.html).

The Synopses are continually edited because the more we think about
the syntax and semantics, the more detailed the picture gets. The
other important input comes from the implementors. They uncover cases
that worked only in theory, and important corner cases not thought
about before. This mutual influence of specification and
implementation we call the whirlpool model of software development,
which is an intended pun on the well-known waterfall model.

Design changes are usually discussed in the p6l mailing list and the
#perl6 channel on the freenode IRC network.
