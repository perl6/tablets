% Perl 6 Tablets: Introduction

Goal
====

In good Perl tradition, this documentation wishes to be everything to
everybody, even if its main purpose is to teach Perl 6 to the Perl 5
programmer. Therefore I create a sorted and complete list of all
features and details with examples and short comments. Nevertheless I
try to make it readable like a book, require as little previous
knowledge as possible, and explain most things along the way, or at
least explain them in the [Glossary](appendix-g-glossary.html).
A well-functioning mind and a grasp of some basic programming concepts
should therefore be enough to learn Perl 6 with these tablets.
For a brief explanation and some overviews from various points of view,
there are several chapters in the appendix that make it even more useful.



Name
====

The emerald tablets contain wisdom, that can help you understand the
whole creation, as these Perl 6 Tablets help you understanding Perl
6. They are also written such that they can be read and
understood in a helpful manner again and again, on various levels of
consciousness. So we try to do the same with these docs. A table, a word
included in the word tablet, is also something where you can
quickly find specific things. Lastly, I had to prevent namespace
collision with other tutorials.



Structure
=========

This html form is explicitly chosen because hypertext is better for
free learning. You can more easily follow your interest by clicking on
links. (As this attempt is too big for only one editor, the source
Markdown files are stored in a git repository.)
All content is sorted by topic into 10 chapters. Every chapter also has
a fine grained structure, such that single items can be found quickly
and linked to. They begin with the basics and continue slowly to more
depth. So you can end when you have had enough, without missing the
crucial things. You could also read them from top to bottom, one after
the other, without having to look too much backwards or
forwards. Having everything indexed and crosslinked helps you find
what you are interested in.

Chapter 0 is here, while 1 and 2 contain useful theoretical knowledge.
Chapter 3 .. 10 are about the concrete syntax and appendix A is the
Index, that lists all operators and keywords, alphabetically ordered.
Appendix B holds all tables like operator precedence,
C is the cookbook which shows you common algorithms in native Perl 6.
Appendix D is a kind of 'perldelta' describing the most drastic changes
between a fairly recent version of Perl 5 and Perl 6.
E stands for exciting or excellence showing just the glamorous and
fast to understand bits to impress the world.
Links to other information sources are to be found in F and G stands
for [glossary](appendix-g-glossary.html)
where all the computer science terms are explained.


Motivation
==========

I started this here because I believe in the ideas of Perl 6 and I
wish wholeheartedly that our dream comes true. But on the other hand,
I have my own projects in perl 5 and like writing productive code much
more. So I decided to be, as audrey puts it so funnily, an english
hacker and help others to ease their way into the world of these
glorious ideas.



History
=======

These tablets started as my initial effort to write German Perl 6
documentation. It currently just lays dormant in the german Perl wiki.
Ruins of my first attempt to translate this into English can still be
excavated down under, but let's make it more official here.
