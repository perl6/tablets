% Perl 6 Tablet 2 - Basic Syntax

Basics don't always mean easy, but fundamental.

Defaults
========

Please start your Perl 6 program with one of the following lines.

    #!/usr/bin/perl6
    use v6.0;
    v6;

or just start with a keyword like [**module**](appendix-a-index.html#module)
or [**class**](appendix-a-index.html#class). That marks your code as Perl 6
(in case the interpreter defaults to Perl 5) and makes it possible to mix 
Perl 5 and 6 in one source file.

Where you had to include `use strict;` and `use warnings;` at the top
of every Perl 5 script prior to 5.12, it's default in Perl6. 
Also `use utf8;` is obsolete since any Perl 6 source code is always treated
as UTF-8 and any [*unicode*](appendix-g-glossary.html#unicode) character
can be used anywhere in the code. Even pragmas such as `constants` or `vars`
are now part of the core language.

Also the functionality of many useful and famous modules like Moose
(object system), Parse::RecDescent, exception handling, List::\[More\]Utils,
Exporter, English, an advanced pretty printer and much more is already built in.
So you get a lot extra for a little *v6;**.


Statements and Semicolon
========================

Unless you use [*blocks*](appendix-g-glossary.html#block), a Perl 
program executes one statement after another in linear progression 
(from left to right, top down). They have to be separated by 
a semicolon ([**;**](appendix-a-index.html#semicolon-terminator)),
except before and after a closing curly brace, where it is optional.
Line endings usually have no syntactical effect.

    $coderef = sub { fetch_data(); compute() }


Spaces and Indentation
======================

Perl doesn't care about indentation, but it does care about whitespace
as a disambiguator. For example, `$foo$bar` is a syntax error since that 
are two terms in a row without any whitespace to tell them apart. There's 
a new addition in Perl 6, the so called "unspace" operator. It is basically
an instruction to the compiler's [*lexer*](appendix-g-glossary.html#lexer)
that it should ignore whitespace there.
In other words, the lexer doesn't consider those whitespaces at all. 

    my %hash = "foo" => 42, "bar" => 84; 
    say %hash\  {"foo"}; # Same as saying %hash{"foo"}

    my $clazz = new Camel;
    $clazz\#some random comment
    .drink();                # same as saying $clazz.drink();

    #or even
    $clazz\#`{some random multiline
    comment`}.drink();      # which brings us to the next section...




    ...$var []

    ...$var []

Comments
========


Single Line
-----------

Like in Perl 5 and many other languages of its league, a "#" tells the
compiler to ignore the rest of the line.

    my $var = 'fine'; # that code is boring



Multi Line
----------

Many lines can be commented by using
"**[\#\`](appendix-a-index.html#pound-apostrophe)**"
followed by any pair of braces that surround the comment.

    $things = #`( I wonder how many of these
    I will need, hm maybe 3, or 4, better 5 ) 5; # same as $things = 5;


Documenting Comments
--------------------

When adding an equal sign after the pound like
**[#=](appendix-a-index.html#pound-equal)**, a comment about the following
a subroutine or method is stored.
This comment is accessible via the *[WHY](#WHY-introspection)* introspection
method of the routine object.

    #= ...
    sub {
        ...
    }

POD
---

Even though POD is there to embed documentation, it can be used just for
inserting comments.

    =begin comment
    ...
    =end comment


    $=


[all POD variables](appendix-b-grouped.html#pod-variables)



Quoting
=======

Quoting, like [regular expression](tablet-9-regexes.html), is a sublanguage
inside the main language with its own syntactical rules. It is parsed
by a special grammar which can be found in the [special
variable](appendix-b-grouped.html#special-variables) `$~Quote`. The
operator with the same name (the generic quoting operator `Q`) does
almost nothing, just provides a mechanism to mark the beginning and
end of text sequence.



Delimiter
---------

The examples in this chapter use slashes as the delimier in almost
all cases, however any non-alphanumeric character or pair of matching
(bracing) characters can be used as well.

    Q /.../ or Q |...| or Q *...* or Q "..." or Q[...] ...

An extended delimiter mechanism is delivered by [heredocs](#heredocs).



Interpolation
-------------

Within these delimiters, every character will be taken
literally. Any additional meaning has to be added by [quoting
adverbs](appendix-b-grouped.html#quoting-adverbs) that have to
follow the Q. Most of them have a short and a long name and some of
the most useful have an additional syntax that replaces them
altogether with the Q operator (like single or double quotes).

    :b aka :backslash # control character (implies at least :q)
    :s aka :scalar # scalar variable: $name
    :a aka :array # array variable: @name[...]
    :h aka :hash # hash variable: %name{...}
    :c aka :closure # anonymous blocks: {...}
    :f aka :function # callable routines: &name(...)

For more info on those, see 
    * [scalar variable](ap-b-lookup.html#scalar), 
    * [array variable](ap-b-lookup.html#array), 
    * [hash variable](ap-b-lookup.html#hash), 
    * [anonymous blocks](tablet-6-blocks.html), and 
    * [callable routines](tablet-3-variables.html#callable).

    Q :b /\t\n/; # tab and new line character
    Q :s /$poem/; # content of $poem
    Q :a /@primes[]/; # all number separated by single spaces
    Q :a /@primes[0]/; # returns '2', the first prime
    # returns literally the mail adress, you need the square
    # braces to interpolate arrays
    Q :a /me@primes.de/;
    # all developer names (values, not keys) separated by single
    # spaces, [angle brackets](basic-syntax.html#quote-words) work too
    Q :h /%dev{}/;
    Q :h /%dev[rakudo] %dev<niecza>/; # just 2 values
    Q :h /%dev/; # literally '%dev', you need braces here too
    # returns: 'There are 64 hexagrams in I Ging.', inserts the result
    # of the closure
    Q :c /There are {2**6} hexagrams in I Ging./;
    Q :c /Perl 6 Compiler: {%dev.keys}./; # use it too for method calls
    Q :h /Perl 6 Compiler: %dev.keys./; # no interpolation
    # inserts report of that day, even inside Strings the correctness
    # of arguments will be checked!
    Q :f :a /Here it Tom with the weather: &fetch_report($day)./;
    Q :f :a /fetch_report($day)/; # interpolates just $day
    # literal string '&fetch_report', even if the subroutine takes
    # no arguments
    Q :f :a /&fetch_report/;



Single Quotes
-------------

They provide the most basic mechanism in a convenient syntax. All the
following are synonyms:

    Q :single /.../;
    Q :q /.../;
    q /.../;
    '...'


We sometimes use the backslash (\\) to escape other special characters
or the backslash itself. These are all part of the family of characters
known as /escape sequences/. For example, `\\\\` translates to `\\`, while
`\\'` translates to a `'`. You can avoid all that extra typing by using 
adverbs. 

    'Welcome in Larry\'s madhouse'
    '\'\\'; # string contains: '\
    q |\||; # string contains: |



Double Quotes
-------------

Double quoting combines all the previously mentioned adverbs for
interpolation (also **:q** - implied by **:b**), so all the
following are synonymous.

    Q :s, :a, :h, :f, :c, :b /.../;
    Q :double /.../;
    Q :qq /.../;
    qq /.../;
    "..."

But further adverbs can also be added using q/.../ or qq/.../.



Quote Words
-----------

While other quote operators return a single string item, this one can
return [arrays](tablet-3-variables.html#array) because it splits the string on
any whitespace (\\s aka <ws>).

    Q :words /.../;
    Q :w /.../; # :q implied
    qw/.../; # like Perl 5's qw/.../
    <...>

    Q :quotewords /.../; # qw/.../ with quote protextion
    Q :ww /.../; # :qq implied
    <<>> # also have a unicode alias (chevron)

The second group of aliases mark a modified version, where single and
double quoted strings (inside the quote) are treated as one
word. This is called *quote* protection.

    my @steps = <one "two three">;   # 3 steps to success: ["one", "\"two", "three\""]
    my @steps = <<one "two three">>; # now only 2 steps: ["one", "two three"]


Please note also that **:quotewords** (double pointy braces) implies
**:double** (double quotes), which means all
[interpolation rules](#interpolation) apply here as well.

    <$pi> eq '$pi'   # True
    <<$pi>> == pi    # True (hopefully)


The same pointy braces (quote operators) are also in used when
writing [hash slices](tablet-3-variables.html#hash-slices).



Heredocs
--------

Heredocs are now normal quoted strings, only with a special delimiter, defined
by the adverbs **to** and heredoc. Heredocs can be nested.

    Q :to 'EOT';
    ...
    ...
    EOT

To make templates in which variables and closures are evaluated, take
the normal double quote and just add the adverb for the heredoc
delimiter or define with other adverbs exactly what you want to have
evaluated.

    qq:heredoc 'EOT';
    EOT



Paths
-----

Pathstrings have their own quote operator. This way you get the
warnings early if there is something incompatible with convention.

    Q :path /.../;
    Q :p /.../;
    qp /.../;



Regex
-----

Even being a completely different language than quoting on its own (as
to be defined in *\$\~Regex* and *\$\~P5Regex*), [regular
expressions](tablet-9-regexes.html) can be built using the general quoting
operator with the right adverb.

    Q :regex /.../ aka rx/.../
    Q :subst /.../.../ aka s/.../.../
    Q :trans /.../.../ aka tr/.../.../ aka .trans("..." => "...")



Code
----

The following 3 aliases quote code that will be run immediately (on
runtime) and replaced with the result.

    Q :exec /.../;
    Q :x /.../;
    qx /.../;

In Perl 5, `qx/.../` aka `...` did a system call and not just run
eval. To get that behaviour use:

    qqx/$cmd @args[]/ # do system call and insert result, alias to that is gone

However there is yet another adverb for quasi quoting, meaning: the
quoted code will be parsed and compiled into a abstract syntax tree
(AST - internal representation of the compiler) during compile
time. Result is the compiled AST. Parsing will be done by using the
grammar stored in *\$\~Quasi*. This gets important when writing
[macros](tablet-10-metaprogramming.html#macros).

    Q :code /.../;



Number Literals
===============

Unlike strings, numbers don't need
[quoting](#quoting). But if there is a non number
character in it, there will be an error. Chars of a number definition
are: (0-9,.,+,-,e,E,i,\_) including the [radix
prefixes](#radix-prefixes): (0b,0o,0d,0x) and the
prefix for [version numbering](#version-number)
(v). The + can also act as an operator that converts a string
to numerical context, which means: take form left to right all digits
and interprate as a numeric literal. This will fail if the string
contains any number numeric digits.

A single underscore is allowed only between any two digits, delimiter
helping readability.

    3_456_789; # same as 3456789

    $int = 2;
    $real = 2.2;

    $num = +'123';
    $num = +'123foo'; # fails, 'foo' is not numeric

Radix Prefixes
--------------

Prefixes may be use to enter numbers in the most commonly used
radices.

    0b binary - base 2, digits 0..1
    0o ocatal - base 8, digits 0..7
    0d decimal - base 10, digits 0..9
    0x hexadecimal - base 16, digits 0..9,a..f (case insensitive)



General Radix Form
------------------

Numbers may be entered in any radix using the general radix form, digits
are represented by `0-9` and then `a-z` (case insensitive), so up to base
36 can be represented as a string of digits.

    :10<42> # same as 0d42 or 42
    :36<3z> # 3*(36**1) + 35*(36**0) = 143

Larger radices can be entered as lists of decimal numbers.

    :60[12,34,56]; # 12*(60**2) + 34*(60**1) + 56*(60**0) = 45296

Scientific Notation
-------------------

Scientific notation may be entered using `e` (case insensitive) and
works the way you would expect.

    $float = 60.2e23 # becomes automatically 6.02e24
    $float = 6.02E-23 # capital E works too



Rational Number
---------------

To distinguish them from a division operation, you have to group them
with braces.

    (3/7)
    (3/7).numerator
    (3/7).denominator
    (3/7).nude.perl

As always, [.perl](#perl) gives you an almost source
like code formatting which results here in 3/7. Adding **.nude** you
get (3/7), the nude source code. There are 2 different [immutable
value types](appendix-b-grouped.html#immutable-types) representing
both rational number. FatRat has unlimited precision and Rat has just
enough to be evaled into a Real type. When you explicitly [type a
variable](tablet-3-variables.html#data-types) to one of them, the braces become
optional.

    my Rat $pi_approx = 22/7;
    my FatRat $pi_approx = 2222222222/6981317007; # much more precision



Complex Number
--------------

There is also an [immutable value
type](ap-b-lookup.html#immutable-types) for complex numbers.

    1+2i
    my $c = 5.2+1e42i;
    say $c.WHAT; # returns 'Complex', which is the classname of the value object



Version Number
--------------

    v1.2.3 # okay
    v1.2.* # okay, wildcard version
    v1.2.3+ # okay, wildcard version
    v1.2.3beta # illegal
    Version('1.2.3beta') # okay



Formatting
==========



perl
----

The `.perl` method returns a string that arranges any set of values in
the same format, as it would be defined in source code (if possible).
It's a built in pretty printer similar to Perl 5s Data::Dumper that works
with data of any nesting depth.

    @a.perl # evals to: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    %h.perl # evals to: {"akey" => "avalue", "bkey" => "bvalue"}


gist
----

The `.gist` method returns a summary of an object intended to be read by humans.
For many types it carries more information than plain string conversion with
`.Str`. Most notably, `.gist` on a type object returns the name of the type
object followed by `()` to indicate emptiness.

Notably the [`say`](appendix-a-index.html#say) function uses `.gist`
to convert its arguments to [*strings*](appendix-g-glossary.html#string).

    say Int;    # prints Int()\n


fmt
---

Small brother of sprinf that works as a method of a variable. If thats
a pair or list it formats of course several values in the same way
with same syntax as sprinf.

    $result = '5.123456789';
    say $result.fmt('%.2f'); # "5.12\n"
    @nr = 1..5;
    say @nr.fmt("+%d."); # "+1.+2.+3.+4.+5.\n"
    say @nr.fmt("%d.",','); # "1.,2.,3.,4.,5.\n"
    say @nr.fmt("%d %d"); # ERROR
    %p6c = sorear => 'niecza', fglock => 'perlito';
    say %p6c.fmt("%s!"); # "sorear!\nfglock!\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s",','); # "sorear,fglock!\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s:%s"); # "sorear:niecza\nfglock:perlito\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s:%s",); # "sorear:niecza,fglock:perlito\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s %s %s"); # ERROR



sprintf
-------

Since Algol68 known function, that inserts into a string any number of
special formatted values.
