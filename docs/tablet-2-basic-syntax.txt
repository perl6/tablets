Basics doesn't mean here not always easy but fundamental.

Defaults
========

Please start your Perl 6 program with one of the following lines.

    #!/usr/bin/perl6
    use v6.0;
    v6;

or just start with a keyword like **module** or **class**. That marks
your code as Perl 6 (in case the interpreter defaults to Perl 5) and
makes it possible to mix Perl 5 and 6 in one source file.

To even that little obstacle, you can leave out the usual `use
strict;` and `use warnings;` in front of every script, because thats
now default. Also `use utf;` is obsolete since any Perl 6 source code
is always treated as unicode and any UTF character can be used
anywhere in the code. Even the features of the pragmas `constant` and
`vars` are now part of the core language.

Also the functionality of many useful and famous modules like Moose
(object system), Parse::RecDescent++, exception handling,
List::\[More\]Utils, Export, English an advanced pretty printer and
much more is already built in. So you get a lot extra for a little
**v6;**.



Statements
==========

Unless you use [blocks](blocks.html), a Perl program executes one
statement after another in linear progression (from left to right,
from up to down). They have to be separated by a semicolon (**;**),
except before and after a closing curly brace, where it is optional.

    $coderef = sub { fetch_data(); compute() }



Spaces and Indentation
======================

Perl doesn't care about indentation. And spaces are still in many
places without meaning. However these have become fewer.

Comments
========



Single Line
-----------

Like in Perl 5 and many other languages of its league, a "#" tells the
compiler to ignore the rest of the line.

    my $var = 'good'; # that code is boring



Multi Line
----------

If many lines has to be commented, use "**#\`**" followed by any pair
of braces that surround the comment.

    $things = #`( i wonder how many of these
    I will need, hm maybe 3, or 4, better 5 ) 5; # same as $things = 5;



POD
---

Even though POD is there to embed documentation, it can be used just for
inserting comments.

    =begin comment
    ...
    =end comment


    $=


[all POD variables](ap-b-lookup.html)



Quoting
=======

Quoting, like [regular expression](regexes.html), is a sublanguage
inside the main language with its own syntactical rules. It is parsed
by a special grammar as to be found in the [special
variable](ap-b-lookup.html#special-variables) `$~Quote`. The
operator with the same name (the generic quoting operator `Q`) does
almost nothing, just provides a mechanism to mark the beginning and
end of text sequence.



Delimiter
---------

The examples in this chapter use almost every time slashes for that
purpose, but any not alphanumerical character or pair of matching
(bracing) character can be used as well.

    Q /.../ or Q |...| or Q *...* or Q "..." or Q[...] ...

An extended delimiter mechanism is delivered by [heredocs](#heredocs).



Interpolation
-------------

Inside of these delimiters, every character will be taken
literally. Any additional meaning has to be added by [quoting
adverbs](ap-b-lookup.html#quoting-adverbs) that have to
follow the Q. Most of them have a short and a long name and some of
the most useful have an additional syntax that replaces them
altogether with the Q operator (like single or double quotes).

    :b aka :backslash # control character (implies at least :q)
    :s aka :scalar # scalar variable: $name
    :a aka :array # array variable: @name[...]
    :h aka :hash # hash variable: %name{...}
    :c aka :closure # anonymous blocks: {...}
    :f aka :function # callable routines: &name(...)

For more info on those, see [scalar
variable](ap-b-lookup.html#scalar), [array
variable](ap-b-lookup.html#array), [hash
variable](ap-b-lookup.html#hash), [anonymous
blocks](blocks.html#block), and [callable
routines](variables.html#callable).

    Q :b /\t\n/; # tab and new line character
    Q :s /$poem/; # content of $poem
    Q :a /@primes[]/; # all number separated by single spaces
    Q :a /@primes[0]/; # returns '2', the first prime
    # returns literally the mail adress, you need the square
    # braces to interpolate arrays
    Q :a /me@primes.de/;
    # all developer names (values, not keys) separated by single
    # spaces, [angle brackets](basic-syntax.html#quote-words) work too
    Q :h /%dev{}/;
    Q :h /%dev[rakudo] %dev<niecza>/; # just 2 values
    Q :h /%dev/; # literally '%dev', you need braces here too
    # returns: 'There are 64 hexagrams in I Ging.', inserts the result
    # of the closure
    Q :c /There are {2**6} hexagrams in I Ging./;
    Q :c /Perl 6 Compiler: {%dev.keys}./; # use it too for method calls
    Q :h /Perl 6 Compiler: %dev.keys./; # no interpolation
    # inserts report of that day, even inside Strings the correctness
    # of arguments will be checked!
    Q :f :a /Here it Tom with the weather: &fetch_report($day)./;
    Q :f :a /fetch_report($day)/; # interpolates just $day
    # literal string '&fetch_report', even if the subroutine takes
    # no arguments
    Q :f :a /&fetch_report/;



Single Quotes
-------------

They provide the most basic mechanism in a convenient syntax. All the
following are synonyms:

    Q :single /.../;
    Q :q /.../;
    q /.../;
    '...'


The backslash (\\) liberates here just itself and the single quote
from its special meaning. Or to put it simple \\\\ translates (or
interpolates) to \\ and \\' to '. For anything more you need
additional adverbs.

    'Welcome in Larry\'s madhouse'
    '\'\\'; # string contains: '\
    q |\||; # string contains: |



Double Quotes
-------------

Double quoting combines all the previous mentioned adverbs for
interpolation (also **:q** - implied by **:b**), thatswhy all the
following are synonymous.

    Q :s, :a, :h, :f, :c, :b /.../;
    Q :double /.../;
    Q :qq /.../;
    qq /.../;
    "..."

But further adverbs can also be added using q/.../ or qq/.../.



Quote Words
-----------

While other quote operators return a single string item, this one can
return [arrays](variables.html#array) because it splits the string on
any whitespace (\\s aka <ws>).

    Q :words /.../;
    Q :w /.../; # :q implied
    qw/.../; # like Perl 5's qw/.../
    <...>

    Q :quotewords /.../; # qw/.../ with quote protextion
    Q :ww /.../; # :qq implied
    <<>> # have also a unicode alias (chevron)

The second group of aliases mark a modified version, where single and
double quoted strings (inside the quote) are treated as one
word. Thats called *quote* protection.

    my @steps = <one "two three">; # 3 steps to success: ["one", "\"two", "three\""]
    my @steps = <<one "two three">>; # now only 2 steps: ["one", "two three"]


Please note also that **:quotewords** (double pointy braces) implies
**:double** (double quotes), which means all [interpolation
rules](basic-syntax.html#interpolation) apply here also.

    <$pi> eq '$pi'
    <<$pi>> eq "$pi" # eq '3.14159...'


The same pointy braces (quote operators) are also in used when
writing [hash slices](variables.html#hash-slices).



Heredocs
--------

Heredocs are now normal quoted strings, only with a special delimiter, defined
by the adverbs **to** and heredoc. Heredocs can be nested.

    Q :to 'EOT';
    ...
    ...
    EOT

To make templates in which variables and closures are evaluated, take
the normal double quote and just add the adverb for the heredoc
delimiter or define with other adverbs what exactly you want to have
evaluated.

    qq:heredoc 'EOT';
    EOT



Paths
-----

Pathstrings have their own quote operator. This way you get the
warnings early if there is something incompatible with convention.

    Q :path /.../;
    Q :p /.../;
    qp /.../;



Regex
-----

Even being a completely different language then quoting on its own (as
to be defined in *\$\~Regex* and *\$\~P5Regex*), [regular
expressions](regexes.html) can be built using the general quoting
operator with the right adverb.

    Q :regex /.../ aka rx/.../
    Q :subst /.../.../ aka s/.../.../
    Q :trans /.../.../ aka tr/.../.../ aka .trans("..." => "...")



Code
----

The following 3 aliases quote code that will be run immediately (on
runtime) and replaced with the result.

    Q :exec /.../;
    Q :x /.../;
    qx /.../;

In Perl 5, `qx/.../` aka `...` did a system call and not just run
eval. To get that behaviour use:

    qqx/$cmd @args[]/ # do system call and insert result, alias to that is gone

However there is yet another adverb for quasi quoting, meaning: the
quoted code will be parsed and compiled into a abstract syntax tree
(AST - internal representation of the compiler) during compile
time. Result is the compiled AST. Parsing will be done by using the
grammar stored in *\$\~Quasi*. This gets important when writing
[macros](metaprogramming.html#macros).

    Q :code /.../;



Number Literals
===============

Unlike strings, numbers don't need
[quoting](basic-syntax.html#quoting). But if there is a non number
character in it, there will be an error. Chars of a number definition
are: (0-9,.,+,-,e,E,i,_) including the [radix
prefixes](basic-syntax.html#radix-prefixes): (0b,0o,0d,0x) and the
prefix for [version numbering](basic-syntax.html#version-number)
(v). The + and can act also as operator that convert into the
numerical context, which still means: take from left to right all
digits and stop with the first none number character.

A single underscore is allowed only between any two digits, delimiter
helping readability.

    3_456_789; # same as 3456789

    $int = 2;
    $real = 2.2;



Radix Prefixes
--------------

    0b binary - base 2, digits 0..1
    0o ocatal - base 8, digits 0..7
    0d decimal - base 10, digits 0..9
    0x hexadecimal - base 16, digits 0..9,a..f (case insensitive)



General Radix Form
------------------

    :10<42> # same as 0d42 or 42



Scientific Notation
-------------------

    $float = 60.2e23 # becomes automatically 6.02e24
    $float = 6.02E-23 # capital E works too



Rational Number
---------------

To distinguish them from a division operation, you have to groupe them
with braces.

    (3/7)
    (3/7).numerator
    (3/7).denominator
    (3/7).nude.perl

As always, [.perl](basic-syntax.html#perl) gives you an almost source
like code formatting which results here in 3/7. Adding **.nude** you
get (3/7), the nude source code. There are 2 different [immutable
value types](ap-b-lookup.html#immutable-types) representing
both rational number. FatRat has unlimited precision and Rat has just
enough to be evaled into a Real type. When you explicitly [type a
variable](variables.html#data-types) to one o them, the braces become
optional.

    my Rat $pi_approx = 22/7;
    my FatRat $pi_approx = 2222222222/6981317007; # much more precision



Complex Number
--------------

have also there own [immutable value
type](ap-b-lookup.html#immutable-types).

    1+2i
    my $c = 5.2+1e42i;
    say $c.WHAT; # returns 'Complex', which is the classname of the value object



Version Number
--------------

    v1.2.3 # okay
    v1.2.* # okay, wildcard version
    v1.2.3+ # okay, wildcard version
    v1.2.3beta # illegal
    Version('1.2.3beta') # okay



Formatting
==========



perl
----

The `.perl` method returns a string that arranges any set of values in
almost the same format, as the would be defined it source code. It's a
built in Data::Dumper (pretty printer).

    @a.perl # evals to: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    %h.perl # evals to: {"akey" => "avalue", "bkey" => "bvalue"}

This works with data of any nesting depth.



pretty
------

xxx



fmt
---

Small brother of sprinf that works as a method of a variable. If thats
a pair or list it formats of course several values in the same way
with same syntax as sprinf.

    $result = '5.123456789';
    say $result.fmt('%.2f'); # "5.12\n"
    @nr = 1..5;
    say @nr.fmt("+%d."); # "+1.+2.+3.+4.+5.\n"
    say @nr.fmt("%d.",','); # "1.,2.,3.,4.,5.\n"
    say @nr.fmt("%d %d"); # ERROR
    %p6c = sorear => 'niecza', fglock => 'perlito';
    say %p6c.fmt("%s!"); # "sorear!\nfglock!\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s",','); # "sorear,fglock!\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s:%s"); # "sorear:niecza\nfglock:perlito\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s:%s",); # "sorear:niecza,fglock:perlito\n"
    say %p6c.fmt("%s %s %s"); # ERROR



sprintf
-------

Since Algol68 known function, that inserts into a string any number of
special formatted values.
